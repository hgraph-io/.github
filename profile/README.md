[Hgraph](https://hgraph.com) is a Web3 data infrastructure company focused on providing tooling for the Hedera network and beyond. Our core offerings include Hedera mirror node APIs (GraphQL & REST), bare metal infrastructure, SDKs, the Hedera JSON-RPC, and bespoke software engineering services.

As illustrated in the graphic above, Hgraph's mission is simple: to make data access on the Hedera network easy, flexible, and affordable. We achieve this by focusing on the unique needs of our customers and sharing these innovations with the broader ecosystem.

Our GitHub organization exists to help developers fully leverage Hgraph's data tooling and APIs and to make it easy for first-time users to get started. We‚Äôre excited to expand our products and services in the future and invite the community to be a part of it all here on GitHub!
